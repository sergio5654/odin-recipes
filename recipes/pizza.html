    <h1>PIZZA</h1>

    <h2>HOMEMADE PIZZA</h2>
    <P>The following method I patched together from recipes in both Joy of Cooking and Cook's Illustrated's The Best Recipe. The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10 to 12 inch pizzas.

        Next time I'll be a bit more patient with stretching out the dough so I can get it even thinner.</P>

        <H2>INGREDIENTS</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil
            </li>
            <li>ornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.

                After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
                
                (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

                Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.
                
                If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.
                
                The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.

                At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
                
                Cover the dough with plastic wrap.
                
                For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.

                Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
        </ol>
